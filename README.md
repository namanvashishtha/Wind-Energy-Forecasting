This project involves the analysis of 3 years of wind turbine data measured by a SCADA system. The data has been preprocessed and feature engineering has been performed to select the best parameters for training the model.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The SCADA system's wind turbine data for the past 3 years has been preprocessed to make it suitable for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Various features have been engineered and selected based on their relevance and impact on the model's performance.

3. **Model Implementation:** Various regression and classification algorithms have been implemented and tested to find the best fit for the dataset.
